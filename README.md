Gardening Game 3D is a low poly gardening simulator. It will be developed solely for practice with MonoGame (The framework it is created with) and SharpDX.

There are a few "noteworthy" (not really) features:
  Water is done all in the shader with the help of a geometry shader that is injected into the context before the draw call is run.
